# **Query/Call Logs Maintenance System**

## **Overview**

The Query/Call Logs Maintenance System is a full-stack application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). This system allows users to log their queries, track their status, and receive responses from administrators. Administrators can manage these queries, update their status, and respond to user concerns through a dedicated dashboard.
